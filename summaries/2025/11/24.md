# Activity Summary for 11/24/2025

## 12:08:27 AM
The recent code changes, predominantly occurring on November 23-24, 2025, focus on enhancing user management, registration, and general system functionality, with a notable pattern of internationalization.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\users\list.php`** (Multiple timestamps: 11/23/2025, 11:09:57 PM - 11:50:52 PM)
    *   The user listing view underwent significant localization from Swedish to English. This includes updating button texts (e.g., "New User" to "Add Account", and then adding a plus icon), filter options ("Alla roller" to "All roles", "Aktiva" to "Active", "Filtrera" to "Filter"), table headers ("E-post" to "Email", "Åtgärder" to "Actions"), and various status labels and form messages within the user detail and edit panels.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\index.php`** (Multiple timestamps: 11/23/2025, 11:27:23 PM - 11:59:33 PM)
    *   The main routing configuration was updated. A new route named `'verify_email'` was added, indicating the introduction of an email verification flow for user accounts.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\Viridis Shipiing.session.sql`** (Multiple timestamps: 11/23/2025, 11:45:48 PM - 11/24/2025, 12:07:26 AM)
    *   This file primarily contains a log of executed or attempted SQL commands, indicating active database interaction and testing. Commands include `SELECT * FROM users;`, a `mysqldump` command for database backup, and several `SHOW` commands, some of which appear to have syntax errors, suggesting exploratory database querying.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Helpers\functions.php`** (Multiple timestamps: 11/23/2025, 11:52:09 PM - 11:52:33 PM)
    *   A critical new function, `send_email()`, was introduced. This function leverages PHPMailer to send emails, configuring SMTP settings dynamically from global environment variables. It includes robust error handling for mail delivery.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\RegisterController.php`** (Multiple timestamps: 11/23/2025, 11:53:14 PM - 11:57:57 PM)
    *   The user registration process was significantly revamped to include email verification.
        *   New users are initially registered with an `is_active` status of `0`.
        *   A unique verification token is generated, saved to a new `email_verifications` table with a 24-hour expiration.
        *   A verification link is constructed and sent to the user's email using the newly added `send_email()` helper.
        *   The entire process is wrapped in a PDO transaction for atomicity.
        *   Validation and success messages were updated to reflect the email verification requirement and were fully translated into English.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\VerifyEmailController.php`** (Timestamp: 11/23/2025, 11:58:27 PM)
    *   A new controller was created to handle the email verification logic. It validates the incoming token, checks for its usage and expiration, activates the corresponding user in the `users` table, and marks the token as used in the `email_verifications` table. This operation is also performed within a database transaction.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\LoginController.php`** (Multiple timestamps: 11/24/2025, 12:02:24 AM - 12:02:51 AM)
    *   The login controller was refined. A specific change involved making the successful login flash message more generic by removing the display of the account name, changing it from "Welcome back, [Account Name]" to simply "Welcome back!".

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Internationalization:** There's a clear and consistent effort to translate user-facing text, error messages, and UI elements from Swedish to English across multiple files, especially `users\list.php` and `RegisterController.php`.
*   **Enhanced Security:** The introduction of email verification, alongside existing CSRF protection, rate limiting, and secure password hashing (`password_hash` with Argon2id/bcrypt), indicates a strong focus on improving account security and user authentication flows.
*   **Transactional Database Operations:** Several critical processes, such as user registration and email verification, are implemented using PDO transactions (`beginTransaction`, `commit`, `rollBack`), ensuring data consistency and integrity.
*   **Helper Function Development:** The `src\Helpers\functions.php` file continues to be a central place for reusable utility functions, now expanding to include email sending capabilities.
*   **Concentrated Development:** All changes occurred within a short timeframe (late evening of 11/23/2025 to early morning of 11/24/2025), suggesting a dedicated development session.

## 1:09:03 AM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing user management, registration, and login functionalities, alongside general system improvements and localization efforts. Significant development occurred on 11/23/2025, late evening, and continued into the early morning of 11/24/2025.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Localization/Internationalization:** A clear pattern of translating UI texts from Swedish to English across multiple view files (`users\list.php`, `auth\register.php`) and error messages in controllers (`RegisterController.php`).
*   **Security Enhancements:** Implementation of CSRF protection across forms, session-based rate limiting in the `LoginController`, and a new email verification flow for user registration. Password hashing (`hash_password`, `verify_password`, `needs_rehash`) is standardized to use Argon2id or bcrypt.
*   **Architectural Refinement:** Views (e.g., `auth\register.php`) are refactored to rely on data provided by controllers (`$GLOBALS['FORM_OLD']`, `$GLOBALS['REGISTER_COUNTRIES']`), indicating a move towards a more robust MVC pattern.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Frequent use of Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bg-gray-900`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow-lg`, `border-sky-500`, `inner-shadow`) across view files, with numerous minor adjustments to colors, borders, and shadows to refine the user interface appearance.
*   **Database Interaction:** Recurring SQL statements and commands (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users;`, `mysqldump`) in session logs suggest active development and debugging related to user data and database structure.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\users\list.php**
*   **11/23/2025, 11:09:57 PM:** Initial state. This PHP view provides a comprehensive user management interface. It lists users with their details (username, email, role, status, creation date), supports searching and filtering by various criteria, and includes expandable detail rows. Each detail row displays additional user information and an inline edit form for updating user data, role, and active status. JavaScript functions (`toggleRow`, `closeAllDetailRows`) manage the expandable rows. The UI uses a dark theme with Tailwind CSS, and some labels are in Swedish.
*   **11/23/2025, 11:21:06 PM:** The "New User" button text was updated to "Add Account".
*   **11/23/2025, 11:22:12 PM:** A Font Awesome plus icon (`fa-solid fa-plus`) was added to the "Add Account" button, enhancing its visual appeal.
*   **11/23/2025, 11:50:52 PM:** A major localization effort was completed, translating almost all Swedish UI text labels and form elements (e.g., "Alla roller", "Aktiva", "Filtrera") to their English equivalents (e.g., "All roles", "Active", "Filter").

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\index.php**
*   **11/23/2025, 11:27:23 PM:** This log entry shows the application's central routing configuration. It defines a wide array of routes mapping URL parameters to specific controllers and views for various features like dashboard, inventory, transactions, product management, public pages, authentication (login, register, logout), CRUD operations for containers, products, versions, and users, profile management, and e-commerce functionalities (cart, checkout).
*   **11/23/2025, 11:59:33 PM:** A new route, `verify_email`, was added to the routing configuration, indicating the integration of a new email verification feature.

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Helpers\functions.php**
*   **11/23/2025, 11:52:09 PM:** This file contains a suite of helper functions, including flash messaging, URL redirection, JSON response handling, product image uploading (with WebP conversion and validation), role-based access control, and robust password hashing/verification using modern algorithms (Argon2id/bcrypt).
*   **11/23/2025, 11:52:33 PM:** A new `send_email` helper function was introduced. It integrates PHPMailer to send emails, configuring SMTP settings from global environment variables and including error logging for mail sending issues. This is a critical addition for features like email verification.

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\RegisterController.php**
*   **11/23/2025, 11:53:14 PM:** Initial state of the registration controller. It handles POST requests for user registration, including CSRF validation, basic email and password validation, and a check for unique email addresses. Users were initially activated immediately (`is_active = 1`) upon successful registration. Many error messages were in Swedish.
*   **11/23/2025, 11:53:56 PM:** The registration flow was significantly updated to incorporate email verification. New users are now created as inactive (`is_active = 0`), a verification token is generated and stored, a verification link is constructed, and the newly added `send_email` helper is used to send this link. The process is wrapped in a database transaction for atomicity.
*   **11/23/2025, 11:56:05 PM - 11/23/2025, 11:57:57 PM:** Consecutive changes translated several Swedish validation messages and comments to English, improving the user experience for non-Swedish speakers. For instance, password mismatch messages and unique email checks were translated.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:25:09 AM:** Major refactoring to support an expanded registration form. The controller now handles additional user details like `first_name`, `last_name`, `name`, `phone`, and `country`. It includes new validation rules for these fields and updates the user insertion query accordingly. It also integrates a dynamic list of countries from `config/countries.php` for the registration form, allowing for future restriction of selectable countries.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:25:16 AM:** A minor syntax correction was applied in the country filtering logic (fixing a typo `$` to `$allCountries`).
*   **11/24/2025, 12:25:57 AM:** A temporary change was introduced to hardcode a limited list of `enabledCountryCodes` (`SE`, `NO`, `DK`, `DE`, `US`), likely for testing purposes.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:26:18 AM:** The temporary hardcoded `enabledCountryCodes` were reverted, restoring the default behavior of allowing all countries.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:28:08 AM:** A refined list of `enabledCountryCodes` was re-introduced, restricting registration countries to a broader selection of common EU/European, Middle Eastern, and African nations.

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\VerifyEmailController.php**
*   **11/23/2025, 11:58:27 PM:** This is a new controller dedicated to handling email verification. It validates the provided token, checks its validity and expiration, then activates the corresponding user and marks the token as used, all within a database transaction. It provides specific feedback to the user and redirects to the login page.

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\LoginController.php**
*   **11/24/2025, 12:02:24 AM:** Significant security and functionality enhancements were made. The controller now implements session-based rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks, logs login attempts, uses generic error messages to prevent user enumeration, regenerates session IDs on successful login, and stores a more comprehensive set of user data in the session. Crucially, it checks if an account is active (`is_active`) before allowing login, effectively integrating with the new email verification system.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:02:51 AM:** The success flash message after login was simplified to `flash_success('Welcome back!');` to maintain generic messaging for security reasons, removing an attempt to include the user's email in the message.

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\Viridis Shipiing.session.sql**
*   **11/23/2025, 11:45:48 PM - 11/23/2025, 11:50:47 PM:** These entries show database interaction commands, including an empty file, a `SELECT * FROM users;` query, and a `mysqldump` command, indicating active development or debugging of the database schema and data.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:05:54 AM - 11/24/2025, 12:07:26 AM:** Further SQL commands (`SHOW * users;`, `SHOW * tables FROM users;`, `SHOW * tables users;`, `SHOW * FROM users;`) were logged, likely representing attempts to query or understand the database structure during ongoing development.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:38:22 AM - 11/24/2025, 12:38:30 AM:** More incorrect SQL commands (`SHOW ta FROM users;`, `SHOW tables FROM users;`) were logged, continuing the pattern of database introspection.

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\config\countries.php**
*   **11/24/2025, 12:17:06 AM:** This new file was created to define a comprehensive list of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes mapped to English country names, intended for use in forms like registration.

**c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\register.php**
*   **11/24/2025, 12:14:22 AM:** Initial state of the registration view. It contained its own PHP logic for handling form submission, validation, and database insertion, which would later be externalized to the controller. The form collected first name, last name, optional display name, optional phone, email, and password. UI was in Swedish and dark-themed.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:17:39 AM:** Refactored to externalize PHP logic. The view now dynamically populates form fields using `$GLOBALS['FORM_OLD']` for pre-filling and `$GLOBALS['REGISTER_COUNTRIES']` for a new "Country" dropdown. The visual hierarchy of background elements was also adjusted.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:17:47 AM - 11/24/2025, 12:17:57 AM:** Minor styling adjustments: changed background opacity and added an `inner-shadow` class to a div.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:18:18 AM:** The "Skapa konto" (Create Account) button text was translated to "Register Account".
*   **11/24/2025, 12:20:11 AM:** Button styling was modified with a new background and hover color.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:20:57 AM - 11/24/2025, 12:21:27 AM:** The "Visningsnamn" (Display name) field was relabeled to "Username", its placeholder was changed, and it was marked as a required field in the UI.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:21:47 AM:** A minor styling change to the focus ring of the username input.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:22:08 AM:** A `shadow-lg` class was added to the "Register Account" button.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:22:27 AM:** The login link text was translated from Swedish to English ("Already have an account? Login here!").
*   **11/24/2025, 12:22:53 AM - 11/24/2025, 12:23:11 AM:** Several quick changes to the default value of the "Country" dropdown's "Select country" option, ultimately settling on an empty value for better user selection.
*   **11/24/2025, 1:04:40 AM - 1:06:20 AM:** A series of styling and layout adjustments were made to the overall form container and its inner elements, including changes to `max-width`, `background-color`, borders, hover effects, and padding/margin, refining the visual presentation of the registration form.

**Sensitive File Paths (Not Summarized):**

*   `c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\config\env.php`
    *   Changes were made at **11/24/2025, 12:43:39 AM**, **12:47:03 AM**, **12:49:01 AM**, **1:01:00 AM**, **1:01:07 AM**, **1:01:17 AM**, **1:01:27 AM**, **1:02:10 AM**, **1:03:50 AM**, and **1:04:01 AM**. These changes pertain to database credentials, API keys, and email configuration (SMTP host, username, password, from address/name), indicating setup and refinement of critical system environment variables.

## 3:08:42 AM
The code changes, all occurring on November 24, 2025, predominantly focus on refining user authentication, user interface styling, and introducing enhanced security features. The development activity was concentrated within a few hours.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\Viridis Shipiing.session.sql` (12:06:57 AM - 12:38:30 AM):** This file shows a series of attempts to correctly query tables from the `users` database. Initial syntax errors, such as `SHOW * tables FROM users;` and `SHOW * tables users;`, were progressively corrected, including a temporary typo `SHOW ta FROM users;`, eventually settling on the standard `SHOW tables FROM users;`.
*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\register.php` (12:14:22 AM - 3:02:59 AM):** This view underwent significant refactoring and styling changes.
    *   **Logic Migration:** The initial version contained extensive PHP logic for registration. This logic was later removed from the view, suggesting a move towards a more organized MVC architecture where a controller would handle such processing.
    *   **Form Enhancements:** A "Country" dropdown was added to the registration form (12:17:39 AM). The "Visningsnamn (valfritt)" (Display name (optional)) label was changed to "Username*" with a corresponding placeholder change (12:20:57 AM - 12:21:27 AM).
    *   **Localization/Text Changes:** Several user-facing texts were translated from Swedish to English (e.g., "Skapa konto" to "Register Account" at 12:18:18 AM, "Har du redan konto? Logga in" to "Already have an account? Login here!" at 12:22:27 AM, and the form's introductory paragraph at 1:31:40 AM).
    *   **Styling Refinements:** Numerous Tailwind CSS classes were adjusted, including background opacities (`bg-gray-900/60`, `bg-gray-800/90`), border styles, shadow effects (`inner-shadow`, `shadow-lg`), and input field background colors (`bg-gray-700/70` to `bg-gray-700/50`). There was also a change from `rounded-lg` to `rounded` on several form elements.
    *   **Structural Changes:** The main container structure was modified multiple times, including adjustments to `max-w-xl`, `max-full`, and `w-full` classes, and reallocation of border and shadow styles between outer and inner divs.
    *   **Partial Inclusion:** The `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html>` tags were removed (1:30:21 AM), indicating the file is now intended to be included as a partial within a larger HTML structure.
    *   **CAPTCHA Integration:** A CAPTCHA field was added to the registration form, including an image and a refresh button (3:02:59 AM).
*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\config\countries.php` (12:17:06 AM):** An initial commit of a PHP file defining ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes mapped to English names. This file remained unchanged, serving as a static data source.
*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\RegisterController.php` (12:25:09 AM - 1:18:50 AM):**
    *   **Initial Implementation:** This controller was introduced to handle the registration logic, including CSRF validation, input processing, comprehensive data validation, and the creation of user accounts along with email verification tokens.
    *   **Country Restriction Logic:** Logic was added to restrict the list of selectable countries in the registration form (12:25:57 AM, 12:26:18 AM), with a large set of European, Middle Eastern, and African countries explicitly enabled (12:28:08 AM).
    *   **Email Sending Robustness:** The email sending process was made more fault-tolerant (1:18:50 AM). Registration no longer fails if the verification email cannot be sent; instead, a warning message is displayed, and the user account is still created.
*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\login.php` (12:39:44 AM - 1:32:56 AM):** This login view also saw numerous UI and text adjustments.
    *   **Input Field Changes:** The "E-Mail" label was updated to "E-Mail or Username" (12:39:55 AM). Input field background colors were changed from `bg-gray-800` to `bg-gray-700/50` (1:28:08 AM).
    *   **Styling Consistency:** Similar to the register view, background colors, shadows, and hover effects on borders were consistently adjusted to maintain a dark theme look. The main section gained `ease-in-out duration-300` for smoother transitions on hover (12:42:39 AM).
    *   **Text Refinement:** The login page's main heading and introductory paragraph were added and refined, changing from general registration-related text to specific login instructions (1:32:29 AM - 1:32:56 AM).
*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\assets\css\main.css` (1:19:12 AM - 1:20:58 AM):** This CSS file was updated to adjust styling, particularly for `select` dropdowns. The background color of the `select` element was changed, and later, the `box-shadow` was removed. There were also some transient syntax errors and inconsistencies in styling `select` and `select option` elements.
*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\.htaccess` (1:35:06 AM - 1:35:24 AM):** This Apache configuration file was committed with standard security and routing rules (denying access to sensitive files, setting security headers like CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and rewriting requests to `index.php`). No functional changes were observed across its timestamps, only saves.
*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Helpers\functions.php` (1:37:04 AM - 1:37:17 AM):** This file defines various helper functions for flash messages, redirects, JSON responses, email sending (using PHPMailer), file uploads, role-based access control, and password management. The email verification function still explicitly uses a basic `mail()` function, with a comment noting it should be replaced in production. No functional changes were observed across its timestamps.
*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\captcha.php` (1:44:49 AM - 3:03:38 AM):**
    *   **Initial Implementation:** This file initially provided a basic CAPTCHA image generation script.
    *   **Major Refactor:** The CAPTCHA generation was significantly enhanced (3:03:38 AM). This included implementing strict types, improving randomness using `safe_random_int`, changing the CAPTCHA code length, introducing a background gradient, improving noise generation with alpha transparency, and refining text placement. The session key for the CAPTCHA code was also changed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **User Authentication Focus:** A strong emphasis on user registration and login functionality, including validation, email verification, and UI/UX improvements.
*   **Styling Refinement:** Consistent use of Tailwind CSS with an iterative approach to dark theme styling, adjusting opacities, shadows, and border details across different UI components.
*   **Backend Logic Centralization:** An observed pattern of moving application logic from views into dedicated controller files (e.g., `register.php` to `RegisterController.php`), indicating a move towards better separation of concerns.
*   **Security Enhancements:** Recurring patterns of adding or improving security measures such as CSRF tokens, email verification, and CAPTCHA implementation. The `.htaccess` file also shows robust security header configurations.
*   **Localization Effort:** A clear trend of translating user-facing text from Swedish to English in authentication forms.

## 4:08:30 AM
The provided log details a series of code changes across several PHP files (`RegisterController.php`, `login.php`, `register.php`, `contact.php`, `functions.php`, `captcha.php`), an SQL session file, and a CSS file (`main.css`), including updates to the `.htaccess` file.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\RegisterController.php` (PHP Controller for Registration)**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file was significantly updated between `11/24/2025, 12:28:08 AM` and `11/24/2025, 4:00:11 AM`.
    *   **Initial State (12:28:08 AM):** The controller handled user registration, including CSRF protection, input validation (first name, last name, country, email, password length, password match), unique email check, user creation (inactive by default), email verification token generation, and sending a verification email. It also defined a list of enabled countries for registration. The email sending logic included direct construction of the verification URL and basic `send_email` helper call.
    *   **Changes (1:18:50 AM):** The email sending logic was refined. Instead of throwing a `RuntimeException` on mail failure, it now proceeds with account creation but flashes a warning if the email could not be sent. This makes email sending a "best-effort" step rather than a critical failure point for registration.
    *   **Changes (3:33:10 AM):** The direct email link construction and `send_email` call were replaced with a new `send_verification_email` helper function. There was also a minor change in country validation error handling (`@$errors[] = 'Country is required.';`).
    *   **Changes (3:58:30 AM - 4:00:11 AM):** Integration of ALTCHA human verification was added. The controller now processes an `altcha` field from the POST request, decodes its payload, and verifies it using the `Altcha` library and a `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` from the environment. If ALTCHA verification fails, errors are flashed, and the user is redirected. This adds an additional layer of bot protection to the registration process.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\Viridis Shipiing.session.sql` (SQL Session Log)**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/24/2025, 12:38:22 AM` and `11/24/2025, 12:38:30 AM`.
    *   **Changes:** Two very similar SQL queries were executed: `SHOW ta FROM users;` followed by `SHOW tables FROM users;`. This suggests a quick correction to query the tables in the `users` database.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\login.php` (Login View)**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple changes between `11/24/2025, 12:39:44 AM` and `11/24/2025, 1:32:56 AM`.
    *   **Changes:** The HTML structure and styling of the login form were iteratively adjusted using Tailwind CSS classes.
        *   Initial style was `bg-gray-700` for the section.
        *   Changed "E-Mail" label to "E-Mail or Username" (`12:39:55 AM`).
        *   Changed section background to `bg-gray-900` (`12:41:13 AM`).
        *   Changed main background to `bg-gray-900` and section back to `bg-gray-700` (`12:41:25 AM`).
        *   Added `bg-gray-900/60` and `inner-shadow` to main, adjusted section opacity to `bg-gray-800/60`, and added `ease-in-out duration-300` to hover effects on the border (`12:41:36 AM` - `12:42:39 AM`).
        *   Swapped hover colors for the section border from `hover:border-sky-900` to `hover:border-sky-800` (`12:43:01 AM`).
        *   Input fields were updated to use `bg-gray-700/50` for their background (`1:28:08 AM`).
        *   Added `h1` and `p` elements directly within the `<main>` tag, changing the title to "Login To Your Account" and updating the introductory text (`1:32:29 AM` - `1:32:56 AM`).

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\register.php` (Registration View)**
    *   **Timestamp:** Extensive styling changes between `11/24/2025, 1:04:40 AM` and `11/24/2025, 1:31:40 AM`, and later significant functional changes between `11/24/2025, 3:02:59 AM` and `11/24/2025, 3:35:11 AM`.
    *   **Styling Changes:** Similar to `login.php`, the registration form underwent numerous cosmetic changes involving Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `max-w-xl` to `max-full` for width, `bg-gray-900/60` to `bg-gray-800/90` for background opacity, adding `shadow-lg` and `rounded-lg` to inner div, and adjusting background opacity and border styles for form inputs). Input fields were consistently updated to `bg-gray-700/50` and many received `shadow-lg` classes. The introductory text for the form was changed from Swedish to English ("Fill in your credentials to register an account.") (`1:31:40 AM`).
    *   **Functional Changes (3:02:59 AM - 3:35:11 AM):** A CAPTCHA security check was introduced to the form. This includes an `<img>` tag to display the CAPTCHA image (`/captcha.php`), a "Refresh" button, and an input field for the user to type the CAPTCHA characters. The PHP logic at the top of the file was also updated to include CAPTCHA validation: it checks if the entered CAPTCHA matches the one stored in the session and adds an error if it doesn't. Notably, the PHP code in `register.php` shifted from being a pure view to also containing controller-like logic, handling POST requests and validation (though primarily for CAPTCHA initially).

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\public\contact.php` (Contact Form View)**
    *   **Timestamp:** Minor styling adjustments between `11/24/2025, 1:07:28 AM` and `11/24/2025, 1:08:42 AM`.
    *   **Changes:** Removed `rounded-b-2xl` from the main section and made the form card (`div.bg-gray-900/80`) `w-full`.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\assets\css\main.css` (Main CSS File)**
    *   **Timestamp:** Several quick adjustments between `11/24/2025, 1:19:12 AM` and `11/24/2025, 1:20:58 AM`.
    *   **Changes:** Modified the `background-color` of `select` elements and `select option` elements, initially from `#020617` to `#1E2836`. Later, `box-shadow` and `border` properties were removed from the `select` element and then partially moved to `select option`, suggesting an attempt to fine-tune the appearance of dropdowns.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Helpers\functions.php` (Helper Functions)**
    *   **Timestamp:** Key updates at `11/24/2025, 1:37:04 AM` and `11/24/2025, 3:33:32 AM`.
    *   **Changes (1:37:04 AM):** The `send_verification_email` function was removed and its functionality for constructing the verification URL and sending an email was integrated into the `RegisterController.php` directly.
    *   **Changes (3:33:32 AM):** The `send_verification_email` function was re-introduced and refactored to use the generic `send_email` helper. It now determines the base URL more robustly using `APP_URL` from the environment or dynamically from server variables.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\captcha.php` (CAPTCHA Generator)**
    *   **Timestamp:** Significant overhaul between `11/24/2025, 1:44:49 AM` and `11/24/2025, 3:13:39 AM`.
    *   **Changes:** The CAPTCHA generation logic was greatly improved.
        *   Adopted `declare(strict_types=1);` and added `safe_random_int` and `generateCaptchaCode` helper functions for better code structure and security.
        *   Enhanced visual appearance by implementing a background gradient and more sophisticated noise lines.
        *   Changed image dimensions (`width`, `height`).
        *   Updated background and foreground colors to a blue/gray palette.
        *   Improved font rendering by specifying a TTF font path (`/../assets/fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf`) and dynamically calculating text position, with a fallback to a built-in font if the TTF is not found.
        *   Changed the session key from `captcha_text` to `captcha_code`.
        *   Removed `imagedestroy($image)` as it's not strictly necessary in PHP 8+.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\altcha_challenge.php` (ALTCHA Challenge Generator)**
    *   **Timestamp:** Initial creation at `11/24/2025, 3:56:37 AM` and minor path adjustments afterwards (`4:06:45 AM` - `4:07:31 AM`).
    *   **Changes:** This new file was introduced to generate an ALTCHA cryptographic challenge. It requires `bootstrap.php` and uses the `Altcha` library to create a `SHA256` challenge with a `maxNumber` of 50000 and a 30-second expiry. It expects an `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` from the environment and returns the challenge as JSON. The path to `bootstrap.php` was adjusted from `__DIR__ . '/../config/bootstrap.php'` to `__DIR__ . '/../bootstrap.php'` and then `__DIR__ . '../../bootstrap.php'` before settling on a presumably correct path, implying testing with different relative paths.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\assets\layout\head.php` (HTML Head Section)**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/24/2025, 3:57:46 AM`.
    *   **Changes:** Added a `<script>` tag to load the `altcha.min.js` library, indicating frontend integration for ALTCHA.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\.htaccess` (Apache Configuration)**
    *   **Timestamp:** Several minor changes between `11/24/2025, 1:35:06 AM` and `11/24/2025, 4:08:08 AM`.
    *   **Changes:** Primarily focused on routing. An incorrect `RewriteRules` directive was added (`4:03:50 AM`) and then corrected to `RewriteRule ^altcha-challenge\.php$ - [L]` (`4:08:08 AM`) to explicitly prevent further rewriting for the `altcha-challenge.php` file, ensuring it's served directly.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Tailwind CSS for Styling:** There's a consistent pattern of using and tweaking Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., `bg-gray-900`, `text-gray-300`, `border-sky-800`, `shadow-lg`, `rounded-lg`, `ease-in-out duration-300`) across `login.php`, `register.php`, and `contact.php` for visual enhancements and consistency.
2.  **CSRF Protection:** All form-handling PHP files (`RegisterController.php`, `login.php`) consistently implement CSRF token verification, indicating a focus on security.
3.  **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Flash messages (`flash_success`, `flash_error`, `flash_warning`) are extensively used across controllers and views to provide clear feedback to the user regarding form submissions, validation, and system operations.
4.  **Database Interaction:** PHP Data Objects (PDO) with prepared statements are consistently used for database operations (`$pdo->prepare`, `$stmt->execute`, `beginTransaction`, `commit`, `rollBack`), emphasizing secure and transactional data handling.
5.  **Environment Configuration:** The `config/env.php` file (and implicitly `.env`) is used for storing configuration details, especially for database credentials, API keys, and mailer settings. There's a shift towards commenting out mailer settings in `config/env.php`, implying that these are now primarily read from `.env`.
6.  **Security Enhancements:**
    *   Initial focus on CSRF.
    *   Introduction of image-based CAPTCHA for registration.
    *   Subsequent upgrade from simple CAPTCHA to cryptographic ALTCHA human verification, indicating a progressive approach to bot and spam prevention.
    *   Password hashing uses `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` (likely Argon2id or bcrypt).
7.  **Email Verification Flow:** The registration process includes an email verification step, creating a token and sending a link, with explicit handling for email sending success/failure. The implementation of email sending evolves from inline logic to a dedicated helper function.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **`11/24/2025, 12:28:08 AM`**: Initial complete `RegisterController.php` with email verification.
*   **`11/24/2025, 12:38:xx AM`**: SQL query testing for database tables.
*   **`11/24/2025, 12:39:44 AM` - `11/24/2025, 1:32:56 AM`**: Concentrated styling and minor text changes across `login.php`, `register.php`, and `contact.php`.
*   **`11/24/2025, 1:18:50 AM`**: `RegisterController.php` improved email sending error handling (non-blocking).
*   **`11/24/2025, 1:20:58 AM`**: `main.css` adjusted select/option styling, removing shadows and borders from the main select and adding them to options.
*   **`11/24/2025, 1:25:12 AM`**: `config/env.php` explicitly commented out mailer settings, suggesting a shift to `.env` for mail configuration.
*   **`11/24/2025, 1:44:49 AM` - `11/24/2025, 3:13:39 AM`**: Major rewrite and enhancement of `captcha.php` with better visuals and code structure.
*   **`11/24/2025, 3:02:59 AM` - `11/24/2025, 3:35:11 AM`**: Integration of the CAPTCHA into the `register.php` view and corresponding validation logic.
*   **`11/24/2025, 3:33:32 AM`**: Refactoring of `send_verification_email` into a helper function in `functions.php`.
*   **`11/24/2025, 3:56:37 AM`**: Introduction of `altcha_challenge.php` for advanced bot protection.
*   **`11/24/2025, 3:57:46 AM`**: `head.php` updated to include ALTCHA frontend script.
*   **`11/24/2025, 4:00:04 AM`**: `RegisterController.php` integrated ALTCHA verification, replacing the previous CAPTCHA concept.
*   **`11/24/2025, 4:08:08 AM`**: `.htaccess` updated to handle the new `altcha-challenge.php` file directly.

## 5:09:00 AM
The log details recent development and refinement across several core components, focusing heavily on user authentication, registration, security, and UI styling.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`public\assets\css\main.css` (11/24/2025, 1:20:27 AM - 1:20:58 AM):** This file underwent minor styling adjustments, specifically for `select` and `select option` elements. Initial styles on `select` for background color, border-radius, and border were progressively removed or shifted to the `select option` element. The overall aesthetic maintains a consistent dark theme (`#121824` background, light grey text).
*   **`src\Views\auth\login.php` (11/24/2025, 1:28:08 AM - 1:32:56 AM):** The login page saw refinements to its textual content. Initially, it had a misplaced "Create Account" heading and registration prompt, which were subsequently corrected to "Login To Your Account" and an appropriate login prompt: "Use your account credentials to log in."
*   **`src\Views\auth\register.php` (11/24/2025, 1:28:48 AM - 5:06:34 AM):** This file experienced substantial evolution.
    *   Early changes involved minor formatting, whitespace adjustments, and a language change in the introductory text from Swedish to English ("Fill in your credentials to register an account.").
    *   A significant update at **11/24/2025, 3:02:59 AM** introduced a basic CAPTCHA mechanism with an image, refresh button, and input field.
    *   Further major changes around **11/24/2025, 3:16:51 AM** converted this file from a simple view into a hybrid view-controller, embedding comprehensive PHP logic for registration: CSRF validation, CAPTCHA validation, input sanitization, unique email checks, inactive user creation, email verification token generation, and sending verification emails. It also dynamically populates country options.
    *   Later updates (from **4:35:02 AM**) show the integration of the `altcha.min.js` script in the `<head>` section, indicating a shift towards a more advanced human verification system. The embedded CAPTCHA HTML seems to have been removed or refactored out in favor of this new approach, although the PHP validation logic for a captcha was still present in some intermediate commits.
*   **`.htaccess` (11/24/2025, 1:35:06 AM - 5:02:46 AM):** Security and routing rules were updated.
    *   Initial configurations focused on denying access to sensitive files and setting security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.), along with a front-controller rewrite to `index.php`.
    *   At **11/24/2025, 4:08:08 AM**, a specific `RewriteRule` was added for `altcha-challenge.php` to ensure it's served directly, bypassing `index.php`.
    *   A noticeable change around **11/24/2025, 4:36:42 AM** involved duplicating the `mod_headers.c` block and modifying the `script-src` directive in the Content-Security-Policy to allow scripts from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`, likely for the ALTCHA integration.
*   **`src\Helpers\functions.php` (11/24/2025, 1:37:04 AM - 4:59:20 AM):**
    *   The `send_verification_email` function was significantly improved at **11/24/2025, 3:33:32 AM** to use the more robust `send_email` PHPMailer-based helper instead of the basic `@mail()`, and to generate an HTML email body.
    *   At **11/24/2025, 4:59:20 AM**, a new `env()` helper function was introduced to provide a standardized way to read configuration values from the global `$env` array, `$_ENV`, or `getenv()`.
*   **`public\captcha.php` (11/24/2025, 1:44:49 AM - 3:13:39 AM):** The CAPTCHA image generation script was enhanced.
    *   The initial version generated a basic image with a fixed background.
    *   At **11/24/2025, 3:03:38 AM**, it was refactored to use strict types, introduced helper functions (`safe_random_int`, `generateCaptchaCode`), changed the session key to `captcha_code`, increased image dimensions, implemented a background gradient, and used semi-transparent noise lines for better aesthetics.
    *   Subsequent changes (3:13:39 AM) were minor cleanups.
*   **`src\Controllers\VerifyEmailController.php` (11/24/2025, 3:17:43 AM):** This new controller was introduced to handle email verification, ensuring tokens are valid, not expired, and haven't been used before activating user accounts within a database transaction.
*   **`src\Controllers\RegisterController.php` (11/24/2025, 3:33:10 AM - 5:01:23 AM):** This controller evolved from handling basic registration to incorporating the ALTCHA human verification.
    *   The core logic for registration, email verification token generation, and user account creation remained consistent.
    *   A major feature addition at **11/24/2025, 4:00:04 AM** was the integration of ALTCHA validation, checking the `altcha` payload before proceeding with registration. This relied on `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY`.
    *   There were several temporary regressions in how `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` was handled within this controller, including attempts to use the key's value as a variable name and direct hardcoding (**4:51:25 AM**). This was eventually corrected at **5:01:23 AM** to use the `env()` helper function for secure retrieval.
*   **`public\altcha_challenge.php` (11/24/2025, 3:56:37 AM - 4:26:14 AM):** This file was introduced to generate ALTCHA challenges.
    *   Initial versions created SHA256 challenges valid for 30 seconds, fetching `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` from `$env`.
    *   Multiple path adjustments for `bootstrap.php` were made (from `config/bootstrap.php` to `../bootstrap.php` and then relative paths).
    *   Critically, around **11/24/2025, 4:26:14 AM**, there was a security flaw where the HMAC key was attempted to be fetched using its value as the environment variable name, and later the key was directly hardcoded, which is highly insecure.
*   **`public\assets\layout\head.php` (11/24/2025, 3:57:46 AM - 4:08:35 AM):** The main HTML head included external CSS/JS libraries (Font Awesome, jQuery, Alpine.js, Cropper.js, Tailwind CSS) and, notably at **3:57:46 AM**, added the `altcha.min.js` script for client-side human verification.
*   **`public\index.php` (11/24/2025, 4:10:30 AM - 4:16:54 AM):** The main application router remained relatively stable, defining various routes for public pages, user dashboards, and CRUD operations for containers, products, users, and versions. It included routes for cart/checkout and email verification.
*   **`public\api.php` (11/24/2025, 4:15:02 AM - 5:00:15 AM):** This API dispatcher was created and refined.
    *   Initially, it provided a basic routing mechanism for different API endpoints.
    *   A significant refactor at **11/24/2025, 4:26:50 AM** introduced strict types, robust error handling for unknown endpoints or missing handlers, and explicit `Content-Type` headers. It explicitly added `altcha` as a supported API endpoint.
*   **`src\Api\AltchaApi.php` (11/24/2025, 4:15:28 AM - 4:59:31 AM):** This API handler for ALTCHA challenges underwent several critical changes in how it managed sensitive data.
    *   It started by reading the `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` from `$env`.
    *   At **11/24/2025, 4:24:15 AM**, it became more robust in fetching the `hmacKey` from multiple sources (`$env`, `$_ENV`, `getenv()`).
    *   There were several critical security regressions between **4:24:29 AM** and **4:46:41 AM** where the HMAC key was either incorrectly referenced by its value as the variable name or directly hardcoded into the file.
    *   Finally, at **11/24/2025, 4:59:31 AM**, the key loading was correctly implemented using the newly introduced `env()` helper function, centralizing and securing the configuration retrieval.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Emphasis:** A strong recurring theme is the implementation and strengthening of security measures, including CSRF protection, comprehensive Content Security Policies, and the integration of anti-bot systems (both custom CAPTCHA and later ALTCHA). The handling of the `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` shows a journey from initial implementation to struggles with secure configuration, eventually landing on a more robust solution.
*   **Refinement and Iteration:** Many files, especially CSS and view files, show small, incremental adjustments and corrections (e.g., text, styling, pathing). This indicates an active development cycle with continuous refinement.
*   **Centralized Routing and API:** The `index.php` and `api.php` files act as central dispatchers for application routes and API endpoints, respectively, promoting a structured application architecture.
*   **Helper Functions:** The `src/Helpers/functions.php` file is a central repository for utility functions (flash messages, redirects, email sending, password management, and `env()` lookup), demonstrating a commitment to code reusability and modularity.
*   **Email Verification:** User registration is consistently coupled with an email verification flow, requiring user activation after signup.
*   **Dark UI Theme:** Tailwind CSS classes (`bg-gray-900`, `text-gray-300`, `border-sky-900`) are extensively used across PHP view files (`login.php`, `register.php`), maintaining a consistent dark user interface.
*   **PHP Development Practices:** The code frequently uses `declare(strict_types=1);`, `global $pdo;`, and `try-catch` blocks for error handling, indicating modern PHP development practices.

## 6:08:40 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the implementation and refinement of an ALTCHA human verification system, alongside general application routing and UI adjustments. These updates occurred on 11/24/2025, primarily between 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Controllers\RegisterController.php`**:
    *   Initially, this controller integrated ALTCHA human verification, expecting the `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` from a global `$env` variable (around 4:00 AM).
    *   There were several instances of the `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` being hardcoded directly within the PHP file with various hex strings (e.g., 4:38:58 AM, 4:46:49 AM), or even temporarily commented out, making the system vulnerable or non-functional.
    *   A significant functional shift occurred around 5:01:23 AM where the Altcha verification logic was entirely *replaced* by a simpler, session-based CAPTCHA validation. However, the associated `altcha.min.js` script import remained in the view.
    *   Later, a missing comma in a `global` declaration was fixed (5:40:52 AM), and the explicit declaration of `$env` as a global variable was removed from the view (6:06:46 AM), suggesting a move towards using the `env()` helper function for configuration.
    *   The logic for restricting selectable countries was simplified; a hardcoded list of enabled country codes (EU, Middle East, Africa) was removed, making all countries from `config/countries.php` available by default unless explicitly restricted.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\.htaccess`**:
    *   The file started with standard security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.) and a malformed rewrite rule (4:03:50 AM).
    *   Around 4:08:08 AM, the rewrite rule was corrected to explicitly handle `altcha-challenge.php`.
    *   A duplicate block for `mod_headers.c` was introduced (4:36:42 AM), specifically updating the `script-src` in the Content-Security-Policy to allow `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`, indicating the inclusion of external scripts.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\altcha_challenge.php`**:
    *   This file was introduced (4:06:45 AM) to serve as the endpoint for generating ALTCHA challenges, initially reading the HMAC key from `$env`.
    *   Path issues for `bootstrap.php` were observed and adjusted (4:07:09 AM, 4:07:31 AM).
    *   Critically, at 4:26:14 AM, the HMAC key retrieval was changed to hardcode a specific hex key directly within the `$env` array access, representing a significant security vulnerability.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\assets\layout\head.php`**:
    *   The `<head>` section was configured to include various libraries, notably `altcha.min.js`, supporting the front-end aspect of the ALTCHA integration (4:08:35 AM).

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\index.php`**:
    *   This main entry point saw consistent definitions of application routes (e.g., dashboard, inventory, transactions, user management, and public pages), including new routes for containers and products (4:10:30 AM onwards).
    *   The endpoint `'verify_email'` was partially defined at the end of the routes array, suggesting ongoing work on email verification features (4:10:30 AM).

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\api.php`**:
    *   An API endpoint router was established (4:15:02 AM), mapping requests to specific API handlers, including an initial `'altcha'` endpoint.
    *   The API router was refactored for improved error handling and strict type declarations (4:26:50 AM), and later added a `'translate'` endpoint (5:00:15 AM).

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Api\AltchaApi.php`**:
    *   This file, responsible for generating ALTCHA challenges, saw several revisions to its HMAC key retrieval. Initially it used `$env['ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY']` (4:15:28 AM).
    *   The logic for retrieving the HMAC key was refined to check both `$env` and `getenv()` for `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY` (4:24:15 AM).
    *   However, similar to the `RegisterController`, there were multiple instances of hardcoding specific hex keys directly into the file (e.g., `bf3a19ee1ca81ea9310a7d8ee8e3e1048f9a05aafc1f384be643684a72350e2c` at 4:24:29 AM, and `5f0a0a28a477cf52a0599131c50081d4e5080b2023fc2cf135c3353c25e4fc5b` at 4:46:41 AM), including the use of a placeholder (`PASTE_YOUR_HEX_KEY_HERE`) requiring manual replacement.
    *   Finally, at 4:59:31 AM, the file adopted the `env()` helper function to securely retrieve `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY`, moving away from direct `$env` access and hardcoding.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Helpers\functions.php`**:
    *   A new `env()` helper function was introduced (4:59:20 AM), providing a centralized and safer way to read configuration variables from various sources (`global $env`, `$_ENV`, `getenv()`). This helper also contains other utility functions for flashing messages, redirects, email sending (via PHPMailer), and password hashing.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\login.php`**:
    *   Minor styling adjustments to the login page's logo (`drop-shadow-xl`, `shadi`, `shadow-lg`, `grayscale`, `select-none` classes were applied and removed iteratively between 5:14:07 AM and 5:15:52 AM).

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\assets\css\main.css`**:
    *   This file saw numerous minor aesthetic tweaks to the `altcha-widget` styling, specifically adjusting colors (`--altcha-color-base`, `--altcha-color-footer-bg`) and removing redundant border radius declarations (e.g., 5:36:50 AM to 5:38:46 AM). It also defines general body styles and dropdown options.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\config\countries.php`**:
    *   This file was updated to define a list of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes mapped to country names, intended for use in forms (6:06:31 AM).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **ALTCHA Integration Struggles:** A prominent pattern is the iterative and often insecure handling of the `ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY`. It was initially read from a global variable, then repeatedly hardcoded into multiple PHP files with different hex values and placeholders, before finally settling on the more robust `env()` helper function. This suggests a learning curve or debugging process around secure environment variable management.
*   **Security Concerns:** The frequent hardcoding of sensitive keys (like ALTCHA HMAC) directly in PHP files instead of relying on environment variables or a secure configuration system highlights recurring security concerns that were eventually addressed by the introduction and consistent use of the `env()` helper function.
*   **Refinement of Infrastructure Code:** Improvements were made to the `.htaccess` file for URL rewriting and Content Security Policy, and to `public/api.php` for API routing and error handling, indicating a move towards more robust and maintainable application infrastructure.
*   **UI/UX Adjustments:** The `main.css` file shows continuous fine-tuning of colors and styles for the `altcha-widget` and general UI elements, reflecting an iterative design process.
*   **Functional Shifts:** The `RegisterController.php` showed a temporary shift from ALTCHA to a session-based CAPTCHA, indicating experimentation or re-evaluation of human verification methods.
*   **Configuration Centralization:** The introduction of `src/Helpers/functions.php` with a centralized `env()` function demonstrates an effort to improve configuration management across the application.

## 6:27:19 PM
The provided log details a series of code changes across three PHP view files and one CSS file, all occurring on 11/24/2025. The changes primarily focus on UI/UX refinements, localization, and structural adjustments for different public and authenticated pages.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\public\contact.php`**
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:27:39 PM:** The initial entry for this file establishes a contact form with fields for name, email, phone, topic, message, and a consent checkbox, styled with Tailwind CSS for a dark theme. It also includes basic PHP for handling CSRF tokens, pre-filling data, and defining contact topics. The initial support email placeholder was `support@yourdomain.tld`.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:28:01 PM & 5:28:28 PM:** Minor styling adjustments were made to the phone number input field, specifically adding `w-full` classes to ensure proper width within its grid layout.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:29:01 PM:** The support email address in the footer was updated from `support@yourdomain.tld` to `support@viridiscorp.com`.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:29:18 PM:** A `transition ease-in-out duration-300` was added to the "Send Message" button, likely to improve user feedback on interaction.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:30:13 PM & 5:30:22 PM:** The label for the "topic" dropdown in the form underwent a brief change from "Interested In" to "Possible topic" and then back to "Topics", indicating iterative refinement of the form's labels.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\login.php`**
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:31:14 PM:** This timestamp introduces the login page, which features PHP logic for user authentication, CSRF protection, and session management. Initially, its HTML header incorrectly displayed "Contact Us" content, and error messages were in Swedish.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:31:53 PM & 5:32:27 PM:** The page header was significantly corrected and improved: the sub-title changed to "Viridis Corp - Shipping", the main title became "Log In", and a descriptive paragraph "Log in to your dashboard to manage it" was added.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:45:57 PM:** All Swedish error messages in the PHP logic were localized to English (e.g., `Ogiltig CSRF-token.` became `Invalid CSRF token.`). Additionally, the "Sign up now!" link's styling was updated to `text-sky-600 hover:text-sky-300`, and a transition was added to the login button.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:46:26 PM:** The padding around the "Not a member?" paragraph was reduced.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\register.php`**
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:32:55 PM:** This entry marks the initial structure for the registration page, featuring comprehensive server-side validation, CSRF, and CAPTCHA integration (`altcha`). It includes fields for personal details, email, and password, and generates an email verification token upon successful registration.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:33:02 PM - 5:34:38 PM:** There was a series of structural and content changes to the page's header section. Initially, it erroneously mirrored the "Log In" header from the login page, and its placement within the HTML structure was moved around multiple times before stabilization.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:35:20 PM:** The header content was finally corrected to accurately reflect a registration page, changing the main title to "Sign Up" and the description to "Fill in your credentials to sign up and create an account."
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:35:46 PM - 5:39:03 PM:** Minor styling adjustments occurred, including a change to the `body` background opacity and corrections of typos in CSS class names. The header's bottom margin (`mb-6`) was also increased.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:43:19 PM & 5:43:39 PM:** Padding classes for the inner form container were adjusted, with `p-12` being applied on smaller screens and `p-8` on medium screens and up.
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:47:57 PM:** The inner form container's border radius was increased (`rounded` to `rounded-lg`).

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\assets\css\main.css`**
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:39:39 PM:** This file defines global styles, including `body` background and font, as well as dark-theme specific styling for `select` elements and the `altcha-widget` (CAPTCHA).
    *   **11/24/2025, 5:39:52 PM:** The `--altcha-color-base` variable for the CAPTCHA widget was slightly adjusted from `#1d2735` to `#232f41`, indicating a minor color refinement.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\users\list.php`**
    *   **11/24/2025, 6:20:00 PM:** This file defines the User Management page, featuring a table to display users, filtering options, and an "Add Account" button. Each user row is collapsible to reveal detailed information and an edit form. The page is designed for authenticated users, especially administrators.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\assets\layout\navbar.php`**
    *   **11/24/2025, 6:20:43 PM:** This file contains extensive PHP logic to render a dynamic sidebar or top navigation based on user roles and current page. It supports user authentication, displays user details (name, avatar), and manages navigation links for different sections like Dashboard, Marketplace, Management, Transactions, and Advanced Settings. For administrators, the sidebar includes links to "All Orders".
    *   **11/24/2025, 6:20:55 PM - 6:21:30 PM:** The link for "All Orders" in the admin sidebar repeatedly changed between `?page=transactions` and `?page=my_orders`, indicating a decision process or minor back-and-forth about the correct endpoint or naming convention for this navigation item. It settled on `?page=my_orders` in the last listed change.
    *   **11/24/2025, 6:25:39 PM & 6:25:46 PM:** The logo image size in the sidebar was adjusted, ultimately increasing its width to `w-12`.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\containers\list.php`**
    *   **11/24/2025, 6:22:37 PM:** This file presents a Container Management page, displaying a table of shipping containers with details such as route, capacity, status, and estimated dates. Each container row can be expanded to show more info, a list of associated products, and an inline edit form for container details. Statuses are visually represented with colored badges.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dark Theme & Tailwind CSS:** A consistent dark theme is applied across all front-end files using Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bg-gray-900`, `text-gray-100`, `border-sky-900`, `shadow-lg`, `rounded-lg`). Many changes involved slight adjustments to these classes for visual polish, often including `transition ease-in-out duration-300`.
*   **PHP for Dynamic Content and Logic:** All PHP view files (`.php`) leverage PHP heavily for rendering dynamic content, handling form submissions, pre-filling input fields, and implementing conditional logic based on data or user state.
*   **Security Features:** CSRF protection (`verify_csrf`, hidden `csrf` fields) is consistently implemented in all forms, and CAPTCHA (`altcha`) is used on the registration page, indicating a strong focus on preventing common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Authentication Middleware (`Src\Middleware\Auth`):** The `Auth` middleware is used across the system to manage user roles (`isAdmin`, `user`, `guest`, `authenticated`) and to control access to different parts of the application, especially for navigation and dashboard features.
*   **Modular Layout and Reusability:** The `navbar.php` is included in other view files, centralizing navigation logic and ensuring consistency. Helper functions (e.g., `v()`, `activeSide()`, `topActive()`) are used to maintain clean and efficient code for common tasks.
*   **Iterative UI/UX Refinement:** Numerous small changes to labels, padding, colors, and the introduction of transitions suggest an ongoing process of refining the user interface and user experience based on feedback or design iterations.
*   **Collapsible UI Elements:** Both the user and container listing pages utilize JavaScript and CSS to implement collapsible rows for displaying detailed information or edit forms, improving data presentation without cluttering the main view.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/24/2025, 5:27:39 PM - 5:30:22 PM:** Minor UI/UX refinements on the `contact.php` page, including form field layout and label text, and an important update to the critical support email address.
*   **11/24/2025, 5:31:14 PM - 5:58:19 PM:** Major content and styling restructuring on `login.php`, transitioning from a generic "Contact Us" header to a specific "Log In" header, updating error messages to English, and refining link/button styles.
*   **11/24/2025, 5:32:55 PM - 5:48:54 PM:** Extensive refactoring of the `register.php` page, including header content, titles, descriptions, and significant adjustments to wrapper element types and styling classes for improved layout and appearance.
*   **11/24/2025, 5:39:39 PM - 5:39:52 PM:** Small but targeted styling update to the captcha widget's base color in `main.css`.
*   **11/24/2025, 6:20:00 PM:** Introduction or substantial update of `users\list.php` to include user management functionality with detailed user views and an expandable edit form.
*   **11/24/2025, 6:20:43 PM - 6:41:59 PM:** Refinements to the `navbar.php` structure, especially for admin navigation links (e.g., "Transactions" to "My Orders"), and dynamic display of user avatars.
*   **11/24/2025, 6:22:37 PM - 7:03:24 PM:** Introduction or substantial update of `containers\list.php` for container management, including detailed container info, product listings, and an inline edit form with dynamic capacity visualization.
*   **11/24/2025, 6:43:23 PM:** Header consistency update in `about-us.php`.
*   **11/24/2025, 6:43:55 PM - 6:45:34 PM:** Significant header and styling adjustments for `privacy.php`, removing extraneous content and standardizing presentation.
*   **11/24/2025, 6:46:29 PM:** Introduction of `terms.php` with new content and styling for terms and conditions.
*   **11/24/2025, 7:06:40 PM - 7:16:02 PM:** Minor path corrections and consistency checks in `head.php` for assets like favicon, main CSS, and app JS.
*   **11/24/2025, 7:13:16 PM - 7:24:01 PM:** Critical security and routing enhancements in `.htaccess`, including updated `Content-Security-Policy` and clearer comments for rewrite rules.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Consistent UI/UX Refinement:** A strong pattern of applying consistent styling (`bg-gray-800/60`, `inner-shadow`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow-lg`, `border-sky-900`, `hover:border-sky-800`, `ease-in-out duration-300`) across public and authentication pages (`contact.php`, `login.php`, `register.php`, `privacy.php`, `terms.php`, `about-us.php`) suggests a global theme or component library being applied or refined.
2.  **Centralized Navigation Logic:** `navbar.php` consistently uses `Src\Middleware\Auth` to manage authentication states (`$user`, `$isAdmin`, `$roles`) and determine rendering logic for sidebar versus top navigation. This indicates a robust, role-based access control system for UI elements.
3.  **Dynamic Content and Data Display:** PHP files frequently fetch and display dynamic data (e.g., `$flash` messages, `$prefill` values, `$users`, `$containers`, `$products`) and use `htmlspecialchars` for output sanitization, emphasizing a focus on security and data integrity.
4.  **Form Validation and CSRF Protection:** All forms (`contact.php`, `login.php`, `register.php`, `users\list.php`, `containers\list.php`) implement CSRF token checks (`verify_csrf`) and often include client-side or basic server-side validation (`required` attributes, email format checks, password length).
5.  **Admin-Specific Features:** The `navbar.php`, `users\list.php`, and `containers\list.php` files clearly delineate administrative functionality, including user management, container/product listings with editing capabilities, and an "Advanced Settings" section, accessible only to admin users.
6.  **Accessibility and User Feedback:** Elements like `flash_success` and `flash_error` messages provide immediate feedback to users, while `sr-only` classes and detailed form labels enhance accessibility.
7.  **External Library Integration:** The continued use and refinement of external libraries like Font Awesome, Alpine.js, Cropper.js, jQuery, and Tailwind CSS (`main.css`, `head.php`, `.htaccess`) demonstrate a modern web development stack. The updates to `Content-Security-Policy` in `.htaccess` specifically address securing the inclusion of these external resources.
8.  **Layout Structure:** Repeated use of `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 md:px-10` for main content areas and `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4` for form layouts indicates a responsive design approach.
9.  **Language Consistency:** The `login.php` file saw a direct translation of error messages from Swedish to English, suggesting a move towards English as the primary user-facing language for system messages.

    *   Manages the HTML `<head>` section, including title, meta tags, favicon, and external CSS/JS libraries (Font Awesome, jQuery, Alpine.js, Cropper.js, Tailwind CSS, Altcha).
    *   Fetches the application version from a database.
    *   **Key changes include path adjustments for assets (`main.css`, `app.js`, `favicon.ico`), shifting from relative to absolute or adjusted relative paths.**

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\.htaccess` (Multiple timestamps from 7:13:16 PM to 9:59:10 PM)**
    *   This file underwent several iterations of refinement, primarily focused on security and URL rewriting.
    *   It consistently enables the rewrite engine, disables directory indexing, and blocks direct access to sensitive project files (e.g., composer files, `phpunit.xml`, database backups/logs).
    *   HTTP methods are restricted to `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`.
    *   Security headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `X-XSS-Protection` are consistently set.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP)** configuration was a significant focus, evolving to explicitly allow `self`, `data:`, `https:` for images, and specific external CDNs (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `cdn.tailwindcss.com`, `unpkg.com`, `code.jquery.com`) for scripts. Later updates explicitly added `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` to `script-src` and `style-src` for dynamic JS/CSS, and ensured any previous CSP was unset before applying the new one.
    *   The `altcha-challenge.php` file is explicitly excluded from rewrite rules, and all other requests are routed through `index.php` unless they are for existing files or directories.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\auth\login.php` (Multiple timestamps from 7:29:15 PM to 7:32:09 PM)**
    *   Implements the user login page with CSRF protection and session management upon successful authentication.
    *   Redirects administrators to the dashboard and other users to their respective dashboards.
    *   The background image for the login panel was updated from `.png` to `.webp` format.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\public\assets\layout\footer.php` (11/24/2025, 7:34:08 PM)**
    *   Defines the application footer, dynamically displaying the software version (fetched from DB).
    *   Provides quick links that vary based on the user's authentication status (guest vs. authenticated).
    *   Includes links to legal pages (Privacy & GDPR Policy, Terms & Conditions).

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\public\home.php` (Multiple timestamps from 10:00:26 PM to 10:01:05 PM)**
    *   The public homepage features a hero slideshow implemented with Alpine.js, showcasing "Transparent logistics", "Plan smart, deliver faster", and "Built for reliability".
    *   Includes CTA panels for account creation and login.
    *   Sections describe "How it works" (3 steps), "Why choose us?" (4 features), and "Trusted by" (placeholder logos).
    *   The "Shortcuts" section was refined: the "Explore products" link now points to "inventory", and a "Must be logged in" message was added under the "Track containers" shortcut.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\products\create.php` (Multiple timestamps from 10:16:40 PM to 10:48:49 PM)**
    *   The product creation form for administrators.
    *   Extensive form fields cover basic information (name, display name, category, type, manufacturer, model, description), price and stock details, dimensions and weight, mounting and compliance, and climate data.
    *   **Key functional changes include converting several detailed sections (Dimensions & Weight, Mounting & Compliance, Climate) into collapsible elements using `data-collapse-toggle` buttons.**
    *   A main page header was added with "PRODUCT MANAGEMENT" breadcrumb and a descriptive text.
    *   The layout of product details sections was restructured into a two-column grid.
    *   Help text for container selection was updated.
    *   An ID collision within the Climate section's collapse toggles was resolved.

*   **`c:\xampp\htdocs\ShipmentxDemontera\src\Views\products\list.php` (Multiple timestamps from 10:35:28 PM to 10:36:47 PM)**
    *   The product listing page allows filtering products by search query, status, and container, with adjustable products per page.
    *   Displays product cards with essential details and admin actions (Edit, View, Delete).
    *   Includes pagination controls.
    *   Minor layout adjustments were made, mainly to padding within the main content area.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Styling and Theming**: A strong pattern of using Tailwind CSS classes for a dark, modern UI is evident across all files. Elements frequently use `bg-gray-*`, `text-gray-*`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow-lg`, `border border-gray-700`, and `transition ease-in-out duration-300` for visual consistency.
*   **Authentication-Driven Content**: Many UI elements, especially in the `navbar.php` and `footer.php`, are rendered conditionally based on whether a user is authenticated or an administrator, leveraging `Src\Middleware\Auth`.
*   **CSRF Protection**: All forms consistently employ CSRF tokens to enhance security.
*   **Database Interaction**: Frequent use of PDO for fetching dynamic content (e.g., product data, container lists, user avatars, version information).
*   **User Experience Enhancements**: The introduction of collapsible sections in product creation, interactive hero sliders, and clear pagination demonstrates an ongoing effort to improve the user interface and usability.
*   **Security Configuration**: The `.htaccess` file shows a strong emphasis on server-level security, including extensive Content Security Policy configurations to mitigate various web vulnerabilities.
*   **Incremental Refinement**: Many files, particularly `privacy.php`, `home.php`, `products\create.php`, and `products\list.php`, show multiple commits with very small, iterative changes to styling, text, or structural elements, indicating a gradual process of design and functional improvement.
*   **Pathing Adjustments**: Changes in `head.php` suggest issues or refinements in how assets are referenced, moving between relative and absolute paths.
